# Build a development version

Given the fact that we use git as VCS, we can not use the tag_svn_revision
feature of egg_info. Therefor we make use of the gitegginfo module.

The following command makes use of it and creates the necessary egg-info
directory using the current commit hash appended:

     `python setup.py gitegginfo --tag-git-desc --tag-build .dev develop`

# Run tests

     `python setup.py test`

# Create a source/wheel package

	`python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload`
